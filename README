Git-keys - README
*****************

Git-keys is a free tool designed to create an easy way to manage authorized ssh keys
for a 'git' user on a server that hosts git repositories.  This tool is intended to
create easy access to a git user's .ssh directory when the git user doesn't allow
shell access.

USAGE
=====

    Due to the cross user nature of the tool, `git-keys' must be run with root
permissions, either as the root user or with `sudo'.  The git-keys tool has commands
for four actions: add, clean, list, and remove. The syntax for each command is as 
follows:

    git-keys add <key-file>
            Adds the key stored in <key-file> to the authorized keys for the git 
        user. The <key-file> should be the public key for a user wishing to have
        access to the git repository, and should not have another key stored from
        the same machine.

    git-keys clean
            Removes all the keys stored in the git user's authrorized keys file.

    git-keys list
            Lists all the authorized keys stored for the git user.

    git-keys remove <user>@<host>
            Removes the key stored for the specified <user> at the specified <host>.


INSTALL/UNINSTALL
=================

    To install the git-keys command simply run `sudo make install' and the package
will be installed to the PREFIX directory.  To uninstall the tool run `sudo make
uninstall', which will remove the script from the PREFIX directory.
